A Perks pack for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GAMMA modpack, utilizing Experience Framework by Orleon: https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/experience-framework

This mod incorporates suitable perks from Anomaly RPG (https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-rpg-1-3), Skills Expansion 2.0 (https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/skills-expansion-for-anomaly-skill-system), as well as brand-new perks created by myself. These range from carry weight increases, reload and swap speed increases, looting, and many more.


For a full lsit of available perks, please visit the following link to a Pastebin with all the details, such as level requirements and ranks: https://pastebin.com/vKWxD7hy


The only mod needed for this pack to work for GAMMA is Experience Framework linked above. For non-GAMMA users, this pack will not work as it may lead to various crashes due to needing certain mods that GAMMA either uses or has created for the modpack itself.
