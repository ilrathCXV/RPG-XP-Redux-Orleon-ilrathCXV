# RPG Perks Pack for GAMMA - ilrathCXV and Orleon
A Perks pack for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GAMMA modpack, utilizing the [Experience Framework](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/experience-framework) created by Orleon.

This mod incorporates suitable perks from [Anomaly RPG](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-rpg-1-3) and my [revised version](https://github.com/ilrathCXV/Anomaly-RPG-Redux---ilrathCXV), perks created from skills from [Skills Expansion 2.1](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/skills-expansion-for-anomaly-skill-system), as well as brand-new perks created by myself. These range from carry weight increases, reload and swap speed increases, looting improvements, gameplay specialization, and much more.

For a full list of available perks and their level requirements and ranks, check the [Pastebin post here](https://pastebin.com/vKWxD7hy).

The only mod needed for this pack to work for GAMMA is Experience Framework linked above.

For non-GAMMA users, this pack will not work properly as it may lead to various crashes due to needing certain mods that GAMMA uses. Use at your own risk - you will not receive support if you are not using GAMMA alongside this.
